SwiftRecipeParser
=================
This app manages a recipe collection and grocery lists for the user. The recipe collection and grocery lists are stored in a Core Data database. 

The recipe collection is created by parsing through recipes in XML format. The grocery lists are created by adding items from the recipes, or by ad hoc addition on the Grocery List Detail Screen.

The app was originally written in Objective-C, and then converted to Swift in order to gain experience with the
language.
