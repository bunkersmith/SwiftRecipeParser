    <instructions>We recommend, though it's not required, that you soak the terracotta dome in cold water for 15 minutes before using.

Cut 1/2" to 3/4" off top of garlic bulb, exposing the clove tops.

(If using Elephant Garlic, slice off 1" or more.)

Remove some of the loose outer skin, but not all, leaving the bulb intact.

Place garlic on the glazed terracotta base.

(To make the results even creamier, pour approximately 1 tablespoon of olive oil on top of the bulb.)

Cover with dome and place in a cold oven.

Set temperature at 325 to 350 degrees (F), and bake for 50 to 60 minutes.

To roast in the microwave, prepare as above, and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on medium, or 2 to 3 minutes on high. Depending on the power of your microwave oven, you may need to cook it for up to 50 seconds more.

Serve the roasted garlic whole. Squeeze each clove and spread the soft garlic onto hot, crusty French bread rounds, or crispy crackers.

Also great for use in dips and dishes.

To roast onions, wash a medium sized onion, butter the glazed plate, and bake at 350 degrees (F) for approximately 90 minutes or until tender. Slice off the root end (about 1/4") and squeeze soft onion out from skin. Great topping for seafood, steaks and poultry, or add to pasta, omelets, sandwiches, etc.</instructions>
