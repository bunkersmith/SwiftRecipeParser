    <instructions>1. Turn on an oven broiler

2. Cut the chilies in half lengthwise and remove the stems and seeds.

3. Place ten of the chili halves skin side up on a foil-lined baking sheet and press them down as flat as possible (this insures that they will cook evenly)

4. Put the baking sheet in the oven on the next-to-top rack

5. Cook the chilies in three increments of four minutes each, flipping them over after each four-minute increment

6. Place the hot chilies in a sealed plastic bag for 15 minutes to loosen the skins

7. After the 15 minutes are up, peel the skins off the chilies

NOTE: Ovens vary - adjust the times in step 5 to cook the chilies until the outsides are wrinkled and somewhat blackened, and the meat is completely softened. 

ADDITIONAL INFO: Poblano chilies are frequently, but incorrectly, called Pasilla chilies bygrocery stores.  Poblanos are a large, dark green, somewhat triangularly-shaped pepper.
