    <instructions>Peel peaches: Cut a small x in the blossom end of each peach. Place peaches in boiling water for about 30 seconds. Remove from boiling water and quickly submerge in ice cold water for a few minutes, or until cool enough to handle. The skin should slip off. Cut peaches in half and remove pit. Dice peaches and put in a sterilized 1-quart Mason-type jar.

In a saucepan bring the sugar and water to a boil over low heat, washing down any sugar crystals clinging to the sides with a brush dipped in cold water until the sugar is dissolved. Simmer the syrup for 3 minutes and remove it from the heat. Add 1/2 cup brandy, 2 tablespoons at a time, stirring, and let it cool. Stir in the remaining 1 cup brandy.

Pour the syrup over the peaches. Add more brandy if necessary to cover completely. Seal the jar with the lid and store in a cool place for at least 1 month.</instructions>
