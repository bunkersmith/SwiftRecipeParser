Shopped at Trader Joe's in La Jolla Village Square. Bought their house brand mayonnaise, which according to a web thread is the locally-available brand that
is the most like Duke's Mayonnaise (a southern brand used in the south to make Pimiento Cheese.
Cheeses used were also from Trader's - a New York X-tra sharp orange cheddar (yummy!) and a Canadian
X-tra sharp white cheddar (SUPER yummy!).  Still needed to add extra mayonnaise for creaminess, and blend quite a while to reduce the small, hard cheese
chunks. Deleted a Bobby Dean recipe for Pimiento Cheese from our collection that contained cream cheese, because
Southerners on the web (http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/611110">http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/611110) unanimously said "now way" to that
idea! 04/07/11 Shopped at Ralphs in Del Mar Heights, and used two fancy deli cheeses
(from picture) and pimientos/roasted red peppers from deli.
Quantity adjustments: Both cheese amounts were .47
lbs.
Added three extra tablespoons of mayonnaise to increase creaminess (these particular cheeses have a density
more like Parmesan than regular cheddar). Considerable blending time with
the chopper attachment in the large food processor (both after shredding but
before mayonnaise was added, and after mayonnaise and pimientos were added) was
necessary to get a texture that was creamy enough (to eliminate
small, hard cheese chunks).</notes>

    <instructions>Mix the shredded cheeses together with the pimientos. Stir in the mayonnaise. With a metal spoon (pimientos will stain plastic or wood), stir until the mixture is well blended. Add salt and pepper to taste and stir again. Keep covered in the fridge until ready to use. Serve with corn chips or bread.
